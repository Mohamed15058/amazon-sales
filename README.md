# amazon-sales
Objective:
 Analyze the Amazon sales report dataset attached in the mail to extract meaningful insights,
 preprocess the data, create visualizations using Python libraries (matplotlib and seaborn),
 build predictive models, and develop a dashboard for comprehensive data presentation.
 Detailed Task Breakdown
 Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 1. Data Inspection:
 ○ Loadthe dataset and inspect the first few rows to understand its structure.
 ○ Checkthe data types of each column and identify any potential issues.
 2. Summary Statistics:
 ○ Generate summary statistics for numerical and categorical variables.
 ○ Visualize the distribution of key features to identify trends and patterns.
 Step 2: Data Preprocessing
 1. Handling Missing Values:
 ○ Identify columns with missing values and decide on appropriate strategies to
 handle them (e.g., imputation, removal).
 2. Data Type Conversion:
 ○ Convert relevant columns to appropriate data types (e.g., converting Date
 column to datetime format).
 3. Outlier Detection and Treatment:
 ○ Identify and treat outliers in numerical columns to ensure data quality.
 Step 3: Data Visualization
 1. Using Matplotlib and Seaborn:
 ○ Create visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.
 ○ Examples include histograms, bar plots, line plots, and heatmaps.
 2. Visual Analysis:
 ○ Visualize sales trends over time (e.g., monthly sales trends).
 ○ Identify top-selling products and categories using bar plots.
 ○ Analyze regional sales distributions using geographical visualizations.
 Step 4: Predictive Modeling
 1. Building Predictive Models:
 ○ Develop models to predict the order status (Shipped, Canceled, etc.).
 ○ Useclassification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or
 random forests.
2. Model Evaluation:
 ○ Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision,
 recall).
 ○ Perform cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
 Step 5: Dashboard Development
 1. Dashboard Design:
 ○ Create an interactive dashboard to present key insights and visualizations.
 ○ Ensure the dashboard is user-friendly and provides actionable insights at a
 glance.
 2. Tools:
 ○ UsePython libraries like Dash, Plotly, or Streamlite to build the dashboard.
 ○ Integrate visualizations created using matplotlib and seaborn into the
 dashboard
